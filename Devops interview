Aws interview
1) What is EFS ?
EFS is Elstic File System in AWS. It is serverless and scaleable file storage. You can access storage which is both onprem and on the cloud at the same time. It is not free.
2) How to configure S3 with SDN?
It is configured through security fabric connectors.
3) S3 lifecycle policy
Data in a s3 bucket after 30 days of inactivity gets transferred to glacier storage. It is a cheap storage. If unused for another 365 days, data gets permanently deleted.
4) Static website hosting using s3
Put some data in s3 bucket. Write a html page to fetch the data from s3 bucket. Put the html page in a docker file(similat to nginx image) and build an image. Run docker build -it ... access webpage on your browser.
5) Describe your project architecture ?
Self explanatory
6) What is private subnet and public subnet?
Public subnet- data can be accessible to outside world easily without restriction
Private subnet – data isnt accessible to outside world. If you want that to happen, it has to be configured in the NAT gateway.
7) what is NAT gateway ? other way , No one can access the database server from internet but from database server we can download the patch?
8) can we mount s3 on ec2 instance?
Yes
9) can we make s3 bootable?
10) what are routing policy in rout53?
Explain simple routing policy or weighted routing policy ..these 2 are pretty simple to configure.
12) how to take snapshots of a rds database in every 3 hours?
13) how to get the public ips of all ec2 instance under a single user acount ?
14) user’s are complaing they are not able to access the server ,what is approach to fix this ?
Depends on the error logs present in /var/log/messages, dmesg, ping, ssh, network issue, power issue, data center issues, ip remap allocation etc.
15) differnece between security group and NACL?
Security group is where you define your inbound and outbound traffic rules/port numbers etc
NACL – Network attached Access Control list. This only can control the traffic to or from a subnet.
