3. Post section runs at the executive pipelines end point.
Jenkins Interview Questions for Experienced:
1. Briefly explain the working of the jenkins ?
While the developers do some changes in code and execute them to respiratory, then jenkin carries out those changes to a build as it continuously checks the changes taking place in respiratory. Developers get notified when a build fails to work, when build passes then it is placed for the test. If the test is successful the reports are created and delivered to developers, this is a continuous process until the success of all tests and finally code is positioned for production.

1. The continuous process of delivery and deployment is automated by jenkin by using plugins, its process is like the given below.
2. Developers performs different changes of source code for the respiratory of Git
3. Its server continuously checks for the changes of respiratory and a build is created for each check in.
4. Its application is built to position the server for testing and the feedback comes as a result.
5. After the completion of test performance on its server, then on the server of production the build of code is done.
6. Finally through different levels developers are notified by the feedback.
3. What is the process for jenkins ?
1. Developers need to commit the code for the respiratory of source code, then the server of jenkin conducts the respiratory check for changes at general intervals of time.
2. Later commit happens and its server identifies the changes which have taken place, then it pulls those changes and starts creating a new build.
3. When the process fails then that particular team get notification
4. When the process becomes successful, then it deploys its server in the tests.
5. After the completion of the process it provides feedback, and gives notifications for the developer regarding build and its results.
6. Jenkins continues the checking and the entire process repeats continuously.

• We require Hook Url for github connection, that url is available at the setting of the repository.
• We have to add this to the section of webhooks.
• When a job is generated then automatically build is designed by jenkins.
7. How to create a workflow of continuous delivery ?
We are required to design a branch for workflow creation, changes of code and testing takes place in the branch. Those changes collaborate and deliver after the successful completion of the test.

8. Explain pipeline as a code in jenkins ?
It is a technique used to maintain the continuous integration and continuous deployment workflow in code respiratory, without any requirement of any configurations of branch. It includes the declarative and script syntax.
1. Declarative: It is used for simple way for designing the pipelines, the complete pipeline aspects are controlled
2. Scriptive: By using the execution of the lightweight jenkin runs, it is helpful for code as a pipeline.
9. What should we do when our project build breaks ?
It includes to ways for resolving this issue
